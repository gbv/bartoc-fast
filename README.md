# BARTOC Federated Asynchronous Search Tool

This application was developed at UB Basel and hosted at https://bartoc-fast.ub.unibas.ch/ in 2019-2022.

## Future plans and related work

At VZG there are plans to develop a similar service in 2024, depending on outcome [of a funding proposal](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7673393). The programming library [cocoda-sdk](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda-sdk), developed within [project coli-conc](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/), already contains functionaly to remotely access different terminology services (as ["providers"](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda-sdk#providers)) in uniform way. Related work is also planned in the [NFDI Working Group Terminology Services](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6759325) and the proposed NFDI Basic Terminology Service TS4NFDI.
